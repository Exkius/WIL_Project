Week 11 meeting


--What is happening later--


We will watch their videos and asking questions.


They will also ask us questions.


-- Update.--

With the extra time, we were able to get the prototype ready. We were able to convey what we had done. We had a demo recorded for the recording, and can achieve the functionality.

Following a user same. Originally the explanation showed he would be a risk, and therefore unlikely, but adjusting how the was recommended, it approved. 

He was able to identify how to improve his chances.


The backend is a random forest, and then a LIME explainer which creates a simplified instance of the model, and can show which features contributed. With this output we are able to generate graphs and text features. 


-- How was it different --

In how it was presented to the user, we showed in both a visual and textual manner, we also suggested specific ways to improve. 


The other solutions:

They didn't do it to the degree of ours.

-- What we need to do in the report __

Make sure we discuss what exactly each systems does, in the report.

A visual representation of ours vs their's is a good way to show differences.

Also referencing different papers that discuss their model and solution.

-- Moving Forward --


Splitting into two groups:

Group 1 will make the model cleaner.

Group 2 will work on the report.
